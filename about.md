My name is Joe Barrow, and I'm an NLP PhD student at the University of Maryland working for [Professor Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/).
My research interests, and domains I have worked in, are:

1. incorporating inductive bias into deep neural models,
2. user modeling and language learning, and
3. ad hoc information retrieval (mono- and crosslingual).

During my PhD, I've had the good fortune to work at [Amazon's AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) and the [Adobe Document Intelligence Lab](https://adobe.com), as well as with all many of the faculty, students, and post-docs in the [UMD CLIP Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) where I spend most of my time.
