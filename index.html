    My name is Joe Barrow, and I'm an NLP PhD student at the University of Maryland working for [Professor Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/).
    My research interests, and domains I have worked in, are:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>incorporating inductive bias into deep neural models,</li>
    <li>user modeling and language learning, and</li>
    <li>ad hoc information retrieval (mono- and crosslingual).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I'm also deeply interested in <b>writing good research software</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During my PhD, I've had the good fortune to work at [Amazon's AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) and the [Adobe Document Intelligence Lab](https://adobe.com), as well as with all many of the faculty, students, and post-docs in the [UMD CLIP Lab](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) where I spend most of my time.
